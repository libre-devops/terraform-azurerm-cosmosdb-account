# Complete example

A serverless API for Table account (one allowed address range, a system assigned identity, a
custom read only data role, and the deployer holding the built-in contributor role) and a two
region NoSQL account (continuous backup on the 30 day tier, automatic failover, the deployer
holding the built-in reader role on one database), with Cosmos DB Operator chained through the
role-assignment module. The environment comes from the Terraform workspace, not a variable. Run it
with `just e2e complete`, which applies the stack then always destroys it.
